# Heat Maps & Response Models

# This folder contains a couple examples of heat maps that I have created utilizing geocoding and county-level data to map independent voters in Ohio. 
# This folder also has a basic response model that first utilizes supervised machine learning techniques to ID factors of importance and then creates a logistic model to verify the findings of the decision tree analysis. This model provides an example of the technqiues commonly used in data mining and predictive analytics.

# The point of this is to demonstrate competency and skill NOT neccesarily to create a good model. Better data is needed for the response model example.
